# kasper
Kafka stream processing library written in Go.

*This project is in non-working / prototyping stages.*

For stateful processing, checkout the companion library [kv](https://github.com/movio/kasper/tree/master/kv).

This library is heavily inspired by [Apache Samza](http://samza.apache.org).
